# Classroom-Microbit-Communicator
A method to allow children in the classroom to anonymously communicate with their teacher. Includes features such as sending number inputs to show your understanding of a topic. Also includes a feature that can let the teacher know when a student feels uncomfortable or does not understand. Made using MicroPython and Python.

To use this project, simply install the necessary libraries for the Python Terminal script, or convert the file into an EXE file. There should be two versions of the transmitter and receiver code: one is the Hex file, and the other is a text file. If there are any changes that need to be made with the radio groups, then the text files can be edited and flashed onto Micro:bits at https://python.microbit.org/v/2 

Also, the receiver Micro:bit needs to be plugged in via USB, and the transmitter Micro:bit needs to be powered by the battery pack you can get with the Micro:bit.
